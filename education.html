<h3>Primary school</h3>
<p>For primary school, I attended Methodist Girls Primary School Ipoh. 
There were two session, a morning session and evening session, but after i finished school,
they make a new building and have only one session. After UPSR, I remember joining 
 a “senamrobik” competition, unfortunately, my class won the third place. </p>

<h3>Secondary School</h3>
<p>I continue my education at Methodist Girl's Secondary School, which is located just 
close to the elementary school. Unlike other school where the secondary and the primary school are
divided, my school does not have that We even share the main hall and canteen. 
Our class is on a different floor of the same building. All my friends here are the same with the primary school friends.</p>

<h3>university Year</h3>
<p>It was a completely different setting for me when I initially arrived to UiTM Kedah for my Diploma. I met so many wonderful new folks. I also make a lot of memories. I also attend a lot of events.
For my degree, I get the same university. Initially, I wasn't that thrilled because it was the same campus but luckily, some of my friends during Diploma also get in Kedah.</p>
